Cluster is a social platform designed to help people connect through shared interests, values, and activities rather than traditional social media profiles. It uses a structured semantic tagging system to enable precise and dynamic matching, allowing users to discover and engage with nearby communities, events, and discussions tailored to their specific interests. The project aims to implement a custom tag ontology to handle synonyms, context-based relationships, and multi-dimensional identity toggles. Future plans include advanced semantic search, decentralized moderation tools, and AI-driven tag enrichment to enhance user experience while maintaining privacy and control over identity representation.
